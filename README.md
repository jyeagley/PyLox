# PyLox

PyLox is a Python implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter, originally developed in Java as `jlox`. This project is the result of working through the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. The book uses Java for its implementation; however, I have chosen to use Python instead, in order to explore the language and its capabilities.

## About the Author

I am an experienced senior software engineer who is always eager to learn and improve my skills. In this project, I am experimenting with the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT to enhance my productivity and generate code more efficiently.

## ChatGPT in PyLox

As part of this experiment, the majority of the code in PyLox is generated using ChatGPT, an advanced language model by OpenAI. As a result, the code may look different than what you would typically expect from a program written entirely by a human. It is important to note that the generated code may not be perfect and may require some human intervention for refinement.

Please be aware that even this README.md file was generated using ChatGPT, providing a glimpse into the capabilities of this AI model.
